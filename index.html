    <h1>Privacy Policy for NexaSuit</h1>
    <p><strong>Last updated:</strong> September 21, 2025</p>

    <h2>1. Microphone Access</h2>
    <p>Our app requires access to your deviceâ€™s microphone to enable the following features:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Recording voice input for creating tasks.</li>
      <li>Recording voice input for generating meeting summaries using AI.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>We do not use your microphone for any other purpose.</p>

    <h2>2. How We Use Your Voice Data</h2>
    <p>The audio you record is used only to generate tasks and meeting summaries.</p>
    <p><strong>Storage:</strong> 
      If audio is processed locally on your device, it is never uploaded or stored on our servers. 
      If audio is uploaded for AI processing, it is transmitted securely and processed solely for generating summaries and tasks.
    </p>

    <h2>3. Data Sharing</h2>
    <p>We do not sell, rent, or share your voice recordings with third parties for advertising or marketing purposes.</p>
    <p>If third-party AI services are used (e.g., transcription or summarization APIs), they process the audio only to provide the requested functionality, in compliance with their own privacy policies.</p>

    <h2>4. User Control</h2>
    <p>You may choose whether to grant microphone access. If permission is denied, voice recording features may not work, but other parts of the app remain available.</p>
    <p>You may request deletion of any stored audio data by contacting us.</p>

    <h2>5. Security</h2>
    <p>We take reasonable measures to protect your data from unauthorized access, alteration, disclosure, or destruction.</p>

    <h2>6. Changes to This Policy</h2>
    <p>We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time. Any changes will be posted within the app and/or on our website.</p>

    <h2>7. Contact Us</h2>
    <p>If you have questions about this Privacy Policy, please contact us at:</p>
